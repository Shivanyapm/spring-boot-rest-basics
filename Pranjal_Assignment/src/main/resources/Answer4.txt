Yes, we can have different names in the data members than the columns of the Database.
for that we'll make use of @Column annotation.
For that the code of the Item.java class can be modified as:

@Entity
@Table(name = "ITEM")
public class Employee {

   @Column(name = "id")
   private int item_id;

   @Column(name = "name")
   private String item_name;
  }
