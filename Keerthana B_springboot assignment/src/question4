4. In this project, we have used the name of data members(id, name),same as the columns of the Database.
   If I use different names in the data member( e.g: ItemName instead of name ), will I be able to pull the data from Database?
       i. If yes, how?
       i.If no, why ?

answer: Yes we can use different names in the data member and pull the data from Database because these names are used as references to the actual names of values present in database.
Therefore, if we use any other name apart from the name as given to the columns in database,we are just referring to the original column(attributes) in database and we'll be able to pull the data.
