4. In this project, we have used the name of data members(id, name),same as the columns of the Database.
   If I use different names in the data member( e.g: ItemName instead of name ), will I be able to pull the data from Database?
       i. If yes, how?
       i.If no, why ?

Ans: 
    Yes, we can use different names for the data members inorder to access data from database.
    This can be done using the @Column annotation.
