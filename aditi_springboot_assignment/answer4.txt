4. In this project, we have used the name of data members(id, name),same as the columns of the Database.
   If I use different names in the data member( e.g: ItemName instead of name ), will I be able to pull the data from Database?
       i. If yes, how?
       i.If no, why ?

Answer: Yes, we can use different names in the data members and we will still be able to pull data from the database.
	      This is because these names are just the reference to the actual names in database and even if we use another name we are basically refering to the original attribute.
